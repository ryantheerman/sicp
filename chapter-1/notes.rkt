; with tslime installed and configured in vim, i can press <C-h><C-t> on a given line, and that line will be sent to my racket interpreter in the next pane over
(inc 2001)

; if there is not a blank space between the previous line and the currently selected line, my tslime shortcuts will send all lines above the current until a line break. this includes comments and other lisp commands
; it will also send lines below the current
; so unless the line i want to sound is bounded top and bottom by blank lines, they'll get sent via tslime too.
; not the end of the world.
